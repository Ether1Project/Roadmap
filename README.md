## Roadmap

* * *

#### [Decentralized Node Protocol](https://github.com/Ether1Project/Ether1/pull/10)

Decentralized Node-Protocol will remove all centralized aspects to node deployment, management, monitoring, and reward payment.

**Improvements/Protocol Overview:**

1.  Node deployment/indexing will be via smart contract.

2.  Node activity/availability will be verified at the time of reward payment via consensus protocol.

3.  A random node will be selected & verified for payment at each block — addresses will be validated and scrubbed for a malicious activity via consensus.

4.  Individual node status monitoring capability will be available via a local dashboard/front-end installed during node deployment.

The DNP is being utilized on the Ether-1 Production Testnet known as [Xerom](https://xerom.org), we’ve made significant progress & are happy to report it is nearly ready for activation on Ether-1.

**New Features:**

-   Cross-platform Capabilities
-   Custom API Port
-   Custom Swarm Port

**Improvements:**

-   Better Replication
-   Decerease in data usage
-   Better Peer Discover and communication

**Data Usage Decrease:**

V0.0.1 - 24 Hours (Service Node)

                rx      |     tx      |    total    
    ------------------------+-------------+---------
    today     75.95 GiB |   63.15 GiB |  139.10 GiB

V0.0.2 - 24 Hours (Service Node)

                rx      |     tx      |    total    
    ------------------------+-------------+---------
    today     13.75 GiB |   25.99 GiB |   39.74 GiB

71.43% decrease in data usage.

With DNP we can introduce support for Windows, Darwin & ARM Nodes - though it was previously not a priority, you can read [this](https://) article for a better understanding of why we've introduced cross-platform ethoFS.

**Expected Release Quarter: Q4 2019**

#### [Website Revamp](https://github.com/Ether1Project/Roadmap/issues/2)

The Website Revamp will look at improving our SEO, Website UI & body copy.

**Expected Release Quarter: Q1 2020 (Latest)**

* * *

#### [Decentralized On-Chain Governance](https://github.com/Ether1Project/Ether1/pull/6)

This is currently on hold until the deployment of DNP, whilst the nodes still rely on the Ether-1 team for payments and activation we cannot implement a Decentralized governance model as it just doesn’t make sense. If you’d like to learn more about our Decentralized Governance or get involved in its creation by providing feedback you can do so here: <https://github.com/Ether1Project/Ether1/pull/6>

**Expected Release Quarter: Currently Unknown - Requires: ethoFS upgrade as well as DNP**
